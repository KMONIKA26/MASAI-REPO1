# Reqres API Fetch

This project demonstrates how to fetch user data from the Reqres API and display it dynamically on a web page.

## Files

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the web page.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the web page.
- **index.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for fetching data from the API and updating the DOM.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the "Fetch Users" button to fetch user data from the Reqres API.
3. User information (name, email, and avatar) will be displayed in separate cards on the page.

## Code Explanation

### index.html

- The HTML structure includes a button with class `fetch` for fetching data and a div with class `main` for displaying user information.

### styles.css

- Defines styles for the button, user cards, and other elements to ensure a visually appealing layout.

### index.js

- Uses `fetching` function to fetch user data from the Reqres API.
- Uses `myApi` function as an event listener for the button click, which clears existing user information and populates the `main` div with new user cards.

## How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to see the application in action.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
